Docker & Deployment
====================

Quick guide to build, run and deploy this Vite React site.

Local Docker build (production image)
------------------------------------

Build the image locally:

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\midhu\Downloads\Gripzzy'
docker build -t homestaygripzzy:latest .
```

Run the production container (served by nginx):

```powershell
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 homestaygripzzy:latest
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

Run with docker-compose (dev or prod)
------------------------------------

Start production service:

```powershell
docker-compose up --build web
```

Start dev environment (maps local files, hot reload):

```powershell
docker-compose up dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

CI / GitHub Actions
--------------------

A GitHub Actions workflow is included at `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`.
It builds a Docker image and pushes to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`) under
your GitHub account. The workflow uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` for GHCR auth. Optionally
set `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secrets to push to Docker Hub too.

Kubernetes
----------

Manifests are included in `k8s/`:
- `k8s/deployment.yaml` (Deployment) — update the image name to your registry (replace `<OWNER>`).
- `k8s/service.yaml` (Service)

To deploy to a Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
# update the image path in k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
```

Notes
-----
- Make sure `package.json` contains a `build` script (Vite default: `vite build`).
- For private registries, configure credentials appropriately in your CI/CD pipeline.
# Deployment Guide

## Quick Start Deployment

### 1. Vercel (Recommended - Easiest)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to https://vercel.com
3. Click "Import Project"
4. Select your repository
5. Click "Deploy"

Done! Your site is live. Vercel auto-deploys on every push.

### 2. Netlify

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to https://netlify.com
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Choose your repository
5. Set build command: `npm run build`
6. Set publish directory: `dist`
7. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Traditional Hosting (FTP/CPANEL)

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# The 'dist' folder contains all production files
# Upload contents of 'dist' folder to your web server root
```

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Update contact email in `src/config/constants.js`
- [ ] Update phone number in `src/config/constants.js`
- [ ] Replace placeholder images in gallery
- [ ] Replace hero banner image
- [ ] Update about section image
- [ ] Add real testimonials with screenshots
- [ ] Update amenities list if needed
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Test all contact links work
- [ ] Update website title in `index.html`
- [ ] Update meta description in `index.html`

## SEO Optimization

### For Better Search Rankings:

1. **Update Meta Tags** in `index.html`:
```html
<meta name="description" content="Your unique description (160 chars max)">
<meta name="keywords" content="homestay, kerala, trivandrum">
```

2. **Add Google Analytics** (Optional):
```html
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

3. **Add Sitemap** (Auto-generated by search engines, but helpful):
Create `public/sitemap.xml`

4. **Add Robots.txt** (Optional):
Create `public/robots.txt`

## Performance Tips

1. **Optimize Images**:
   - Use WebP format when possible
   - Compress images before uploading
   - Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim

2. **CDN for Images**:
   - Use Cloudinary or ImgIX for image optimization
   - Reduces bandwidth costs

3. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Use Google PageSpeed Insights
   - Aim for >90 score on desktop and mobile

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -r node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

### Port Already in Use (Local Development)
```bash
# Use a different port
npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

### Images Not Loading After Deployment
- Ensure image URLs are absolute or relative paths
- Check that images are in the correct folder
- Use https:// for external images

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Keep dependencies updated: `npm update`
- Review and update content regularly
- Monitor site analytics

### Backup
- Keep your GitHub repository as backup
- Export your database if using dynamic content

## Domain Setup

### Connect Custom Domain
- Go to your hosting provider
- Update DNS settings to point to your hosting
- For Vercel/Netlify: Add domain in project settings

### SSL Certificate
- Vercel/Netlify: Automatic and free
- Traditional hosting: Usually free with hosting provider
